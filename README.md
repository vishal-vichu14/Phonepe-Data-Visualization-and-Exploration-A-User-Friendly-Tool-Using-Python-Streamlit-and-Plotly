# Phonepe-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration-A-User-Friendly-Tool-Using-Python-Streamlit-and-Plotly
This project is designed to Visualize and Explore the data we have from Phonepe. Using plotly  creating plots with the insights we found in data and Creating a interactive insights of data using Streamlit.


## Technology Stack Used
1. Python
2. Plotly
3. Streamlit
4. SQLite

## Packages to install 
1. pip install plotly-express
2. pip install streamlit
3. pip install pandas
4. pip install jsons
5. pip install streamlit-option-menu
6. pip install os

## Approach

1. Create a .py python file and install the all the packages required for the project.
2. Using os fetch the required data for insights from the files and convert them into a DataFrame using pandas.
3. Establish a connection to sqlite3 and create a cursor, which allows us to store our datas in cloud based database.
4. Uplode the DataFrames to the Data base.
5. Using SQL queary retrive the Datas required for your visualization.
6. Using ployly convert the DataFrame into required plots.
7. Write the code for Streamlit application to create a interative data insights.
